3D JavaScript Physics Engine

    APE -3D  (Another Physics Engine) is a JavaScript implementation of the physics  engine covered in Ian Millington’s book  “Game Physics Engine Development“.  Most of the examples provided with the book have also been ported to JavaScript and can be found under the “Demos” folder.  The 3D visualization is based on the “Three.js” library. 

	APE-3D is a general purpose and robust system for real-time simulation of rigid bodies. The library was designed to be used in computer games, but may be applicable to other areas of simulation or research.
